'generate_and_encrypt_env.sh' and 'deploy_with_decryption.sh' need to be generated automatically given the context of any given dockerfile so that only one more .sh exists at first which sniffs out passwords and stores them in the env automatically per your last message in order to bundle it all up into one simple initial .sh file.  In other words, the dockerfile is generated based upon the loadout suggested by the .sh file's prompts to the user and of course the master password for all.
