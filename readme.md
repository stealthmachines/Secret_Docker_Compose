
## 🚀 Secure Docker Compose Environment with Automated Backup and Encryption

A streamlined solution for deploying containerized services using Docker Compose, complete with GPG-encrypted environment variables and automated local and remote backups, accessible only with a master password.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **Dynamic Container Configuration**: Easily add containers with prompts and automatically generate a `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Environment Variable Encryption**: Secure sensitive environment variables using GPG encryption.
- **Automated Local & Remote Backups**: Periodic, encrypted backups for secure storage on your homelab or remote server.
- **Single Master Password**: Manage all secrets with a single master password.

## 📋 Setup Instructions

1. **Clone or Download** this repository with the following files:
   - **`setup_docker_env.sh`**: Main script to configure Docker Compose, environment variables, and encryption.
   - **`deploy_with_decryption.sh`**: Script to start Docker Compose after decrypting environment variables.

2. **Run the Setup Script**:
   ```bash
   ./setup_docker_env.sh
   ```
   - **Setup Prompts**: Configure essential details:
     - Domain name
     - Master password for encryption
     - SSH credentials for remote backup
     - List of containers to add (e.g., `wordpress`, `phpmyadmin`, `mysql`)

3. **Environment Encryption**:
   - Generates a `.env` file with secure, auto-generated passwords.
   - Encrypts `.env` with GPG using your master password, then securely deletes it.

## ⚙️ Usage

### 🚀 Deploying Services

Run `deploy_with_decryption.sh` to decrypt the environment file and start Docker Compose:
```bash
./deploy_with_decryption.sh
```
- **Decryption Prompt**: Enter your master password to decrypt `.env.gpg`.
- **Environment Cleanup**: After deployment, the decrypted `.env` is deleted to maintain security.

### 🔒 Backup Service

The `backup` service in `docker-compose.yml` performs:
- **Local Backups**: Backs up Docker volumes locally.
- **Remote Backup**: Sends encrypted backups to the specified remote SSH server.

## 🔧 Example `docker-compose.yml`

The `docker-compose.yml` generated by the setup script will look like this:

```yaml
version: '3.7'

services:
  wordpress:
    image: wordpress:latest
    container_name: wordpress
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 8080:80
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - wordpress_data:/var/www/html

  phpmyadmin:
    image: phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin
    container_name: phpmyadmin
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 8081:80
    env_file:
      - .env

  db:
    image: mysql:5.7
    container_name: wordpress_db
    restart: always
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql

  backup:
    image: alpine:latest
    container_name: wordpress_backup
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - wordpress_data:/data/wordpress:ro
      - db_data:/data/db:ro
      - ./backup:/backup  # Local backup directory
    env_file:
      - .env
    entrypoint: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
    command: |
      apk add --no-cache duplicity openssh-client rsync bash && \
      echo "0 3 * * * duplicity --encrypt-key \$PASSPHRASE /data file:///backup && \
      rsync -avz -e 'ssh -i /backup/ssh_key' /backup \${BACKUP_SSH_USER}@\${BACKUP_SSH_HOST}:\${BACKUP_SSH_PATH}" | crontab - && \
      crond -f

volumes:
  wordpress_data:
  db_data:
```

## 📄 Files Generated

- **`.env.gpg`**: Encrypted environment variables file containing sensitive credentials.
- **`docker-compose.yml`**: Docker Compose file with services as specified by the user.
- **`deploy_with_decryption.sh`**: Script for decrypting `.env.gpg` and starting services.

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

- **Master Password**: Only required during setup and deployment. Use a strong, unique password.
- **Environment Decryption**: `.env.gpg` is decrypted only at deployment, and `.env` is deleted immediately afterward.
- **Backup Security**: Encrypted backups can only be decrypted with the specified encryption key.

---

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

1. **GPG Decryption Fails**: Verify the master password is correct.
2. **Container Not Found**: Confirm container names on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/search).
3. **Backup Issues**: Check SSH connectivity and remote server permissions.
